# Machine Learning

This repository records learning outcomes and practice code in the field of machine learning. Some notes are updated in my blog at the same time. Basically, the learning route is guided by Li Hang's book. 

# Models to implement

- [x] Perceptron
- [x] k-Nearest Neighbor (simple one)
- [ ] k-Nearest Neighbor (kd tree)
- [x] Naive Bayes
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Decision Tree (Simple)
- [ ] Decision Tree Pruning
- [ ] SVM
